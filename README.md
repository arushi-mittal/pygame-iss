# **River-Crossing Game**

## Overview

The river-crossing game is an interactive, multi-player, multi-level game that involves a rabbit, and a crocodile infested river filled with obstacles.
The goal of the two players is to transport the rabbit to the other bank while ensuring the rabbit does not come into contact with the obstacles, and trying to do so as soon as possible. 

## Instructions and Rules

Player 1 starts the game, and controls the rabbit using the arrow keys and transports the rabbit from the bottom of the screen to the top. Player 2 controls the rabbit using the `W`, `A`, `S` and `D` keys and transports the rabbit from the top of the screen to the bottom. Completing the game before the timer counts down grants the player a bonus, and exceeding the time limit incurs a penalty. Each level has an increase in the difficulty caused by an increase in the speed of the moving obstacles. At the end of the three levels, the player with the most points wins.
